/* ButtonArray
 *
 * This is an abstract base class that should be subclassed as a driver for
 * ButtonArray hardware.  1 and 2/2X series replicators have different hardware
 * and hence need different software implementations.
 *
 * Note that previously, Makerbot used a different set of enum values for
 * the ButtonName enumeration between mighty_one and mighty_two based systems.
 * This introdced bugs elsewhere.  As part of refactoring the code into
 * the ButtonArray base class, the mighty_one values of the enum were used
 * for all button arrays.

/// #scanButtons, which is a fast button scanning routine that should be
/// called from an interrupt, and #getButton, which should be called by a
/// slow loop that has time to respond to the button.

/// Porting Notes:
/// This modules uses low-level port registers, and must be re-written for

/* Note Originally, MBI defined different CONTINUOUS_BUTTON_MASKS for
   mighty_one and mighty_two implementations.  In refactoring this interface,
   the mighty_one bitmask and ButtonName enum values were selected as standard.

   For a mighty_one, this is easy as the pins, masks, and ButtonName values all
   correspond.  (eg bit 0 on PORTJ corresponds to CENTER, which is 0 in the
   enum) Any implementor of a ButtonArray subclass should make sure that
   the class uses this mask and the associated ButtonNames, even if the
   hardware does not correspond.
